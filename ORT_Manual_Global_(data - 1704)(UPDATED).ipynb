forth there without any progress in a number of days.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>As I have mentioned on numerous occasions, I cannot test od example the behaviour of any query without API credentials &amp; there seems to be no feedback on any of the points about credentials from my last message.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Additionally I am not suggesting you use the <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\"><strong>test</strong></span> I suggested to replicate 300 employees &amp; not sure why you interpret the feedback in this way as it is simply a test that has been requested for 1 of <em>(or the 3)</em> sample users you provided in the various division:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>You say there is data is in JMS query &amp; I want to test the <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">exact</span> JMS query that missed them &amp; explicitly filter for the user, <br />this is a very standard API testing approach which I would have done on the day this was reported if credentials were available.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>If the user is returned with filter then they are almost definitely being returned via the regular JMS query with the division filter &amp; the issue could be with your validation of the output because we are still yet to validate this on API end.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>I have requested credentials for testing on my end to progress this &amp; I have suggested tests to do on your end to progress, neither of which seems to have been done.</p>\\n<p>Please let me be very clear here - I can offer no further inputs here currently &amp; we cannot proceed here without these tests &amp; will have no choice be to close the ticket if these point continue to be ignored.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Regards,</p>\\n<p>Jamie</p>[/code]\\n\\n2024-04-08 18:26:19 - Jamie Ryan (I346688) (External Info)\\n[code]<p>Dear Gokula,</p>\\n<p>We discussed the provision of the API credentials on the earlier call.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>As mentioned on this call &amp; in previous tickets on which we worked together, it is not possible to use: \\\"OAuth2 SAML Bearer Assertion\\\" to authenticate against the API &amp; test this from my end</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>If this is the only means by which they can be provided, then please provide the specific step-by-step instructions on how to authenticate against the API <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\"><strong>via a REST client using:</strong></span><br />&nbsp;<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li><em><strong>Authentication:</strong>&nbsp;OAuth2 SAML Bearer Assertion</em></li>\\n<li><em><strong>Credential Name:&nbsp;</strong><strong>OAuth2_SF_PROD<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong></em>As currently it's not clear how we are expected to use this for direct API testing</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Alternatively, please reach out internally to discuss the possibility of providing basic auth credentials for the purposes of testing JMS query against the missed users so we can validate this on API directly:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The IP Range in API Login Exceptions can be removed &amp; API user password changed after testing.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>I have checked the data via UI in the meantime &amp; I cannot find any any further clues as to why they would need to be returned as the data meets the filter criteria, so this needs to be tested directly on API - see attached -&nbsp;<em><strong>BT_sampleData_checks.docx</strong></em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>I understand the credentials may be time consuming to provide but they are needed for accurate testing here so please follow up on this from your end</p>\\n<p>However, in the interest of keeping this moving, as an alternative, &amp; if possible, you can test onf of the JMS runs against one of these employees with an explicit filter, so for example:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>SELECT person(person_id_external,date_of_birth),personal_information,person/address_information(zip_code,country,state,city,address5,address4,address3,address2,address1,address_type),person/phone_information(phone_number,phone_type),person/email_information(email_address,email_type),person/employment_information(isContingentWorker,originalStartDate,seniorityDate,start_date,end_date,assignment_class,user_id),person/employment_information/job_information(division,company,company_territory_code,custom_string22,custom_string24,custom_string25,custom_string26,custom_string28,custom_string21,custom_string34,custom_string36,department,employee_class,emplStatus,event,fte,is_fulltime_employee,job_code,job_title,location,manager_id,regular_temp,standard_hours,start_date,grade,pay_grade,custom_string2,custom_string23,end_date),person/employment_information/compensation_information(pay_group),person/employment_information/WorkOrder(cust_PlannedEndDate) FROM CompoundEmployee <strong>WHERE division IN ('DIV04')</strong> AND isContingentWorker IN ('false') AND snapshot_date = to_datetime('2024-04-02T00:01:00Z') <strong>AND user_id = '802517928'<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Similar to the approach used in the recent Very High issue this should tell us if there is some issue which completely prevents the users being returned (for example permissions like previously )</p>\\n<p>You can create a test process process for this if you wish &amp; please ensure the logs are captured for this test</p>\\n<p>same approach can be applied to any missed user / division in JMS query</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>Please Note: </strong>this suggestion is only in absence of the API credentials &amp; direct testing, as direct testing is by far the quickest way to get this tested &amp; would allow us to gather everything we need from our end to progress here.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Thanks &amp;

forth there without any progress in a number of days.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>As I have mentioned on numerous occasions, I cannot test od example the behaviour of any query without API credentials &amp; there seems to be no feedback on any of the points about credentials from my last message.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Additionally I am not suggesting you use the <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\"><strong>test</strong></span> I suggested to replicate 300 employees &amp; not sure why you interpret the feedback in this way as it is simply a test that has been requested for 1 of <em>(or the 3)</em> sample users you provided in the various division:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>You say there is data is in JMS query &amp; I want to test the <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">exact</span> JMS query that missed them &amp; explicitly filter for the user, <br />this is a very standard API testing approach which I would have done on the day this was reported if credentials were available.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>If the user is returned with filter then they are almost definitely being returned via the regular JMS query with the division filter &amp; the issue could be with your validation of the output because we are still yet to validate this on API end.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>I have requested credentials for testing on my end to progress this &amp; I have suggested tests to do on your end to progress, neither of which seems to have been done.</p>\\n<p>Please let me be very clear here - I can offer no further inputs here currently &amp; we cannot proceed here without these tests &amp; will have no choice be to close the ticket if these point continue to be ignored.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Regards,</p>\\n<p>Jamie</p>[/code]\\n\\n2024-04-08 18:26:19 - Jamie Ryan (I346688) (External Info)\\n[code]<p>Dear Gokula,</p>\\n<p>We discussed the provision of the API credentials on the earlier call.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>As mentioned on this call &amp; in previous tickets on which we worked together, it is not possible to use: \\\"OAuth2 SAML Bearer Assertion\\\" to authenticate against the API &amp; test this from my end</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>If this is the only means by which they can be provided, then please provide the specific step-by-step instructions on how to authenticate against the API <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\"><strong>via a REST client using:</strong></span><br />&nbsp;<br />\\n<ul>\\n<li><em><strong>Authentication:</strong>&nbsp;OAuth2 SAML Bearer Assertion</em></li>\\n<li><em><strong>Credential Name:&nbsp;</strong><strong>OAuth2_SF_PROD<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></strong></em>As currently it's not clear how we are expected to use this for direct API testing</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Alternatively, please reach out internally to discuss the possibility of providing basic auth credentials for the purposes of testing JMS query against the missed users so we can validate this on API directly:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The IP Range in API Login Exceptions can be removed &amp; API user password changed after testing.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>I have checked the data via UI in the meantime &amp; I cannot find any any further clues as to why they would need to be returned as the data meets the filter criteria, so this needs to be tested directly on API - see attached -&nbsp;<em><strong>BT_sampleData_checks.docx</strong></em></p>\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>I understand the credentials may be time consuming to provide but they are needed for accurate testing here so please follow up on this from your end</p>\\n<p>However, in the interest of keeping this moving, as an alternative, &amp; if possible, you can test onf of the JMS runs against one of these employees with an explicit filter, so for example:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>SELECT person(person_id_external,date_of_birth),personal_information,person/address_information(zip_code,country,state,city,address5,address4,address3,address2,address1,address_type),person/phone_information(phone_number,phone_type),person/email_information(email_address,email_type),person/employment_information(isContingentWorker,originalStartDate,seniorityDate,start_date,end_date,assignment_class,user_id),person/employment_information/job_information(division,company,company_territory_code,custom_string22,custom_string24,custom_string25,custom_string26,custom_string28,custom_string21,custom_string34,custom_string36,department,employee_class,emplStatus,event,fte,is_fulltime_employee,job_code,job_title,location,manager_id,regular_temp,standard_hours,start_date,grade,pay_grade,custom_string2,custom_string23,end_date),person/employment_information/compensation_information(pay_group),person/employment_information/WorkOrder(cust_PlannedEndDate) FROM CompoundEmployee <strong>WHERE division IN ('DIV04')</strong> AND isContingentWorker IN ('false') AND snapshot_date = to_datetime('2024-04-02T00:01:00Z') <strong>AND user_id = '802517928'<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /></strong></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Similar to the approach used in the recent Very High issue this should tell us if there is some issue which completely prevents the users being returned (for example permissions like previously )</p>\\n<p>You can create a test process process for this if you wish &amp; please ensure the logs are captured for this test</p>\\n<p>same approach can be applied to any missed user / division in JMS query</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p><strong>Please Note: </strong>this suggestion is only in absence of the API credentials &amp; direct testing, as direct testing is by far the quickest way to get this tested &amp; would allow us to gather everything we need from our end to progress here.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Thanks &amp;

Using the check tool (check in the attachments), the results shows that your user was not successfully synced in SAC tenant, and to do so, the user sync process needs to be executed through the IPS portal. Also, the field \\\"Custom Attribute 1\\\" needs to be populated with the \\\"Per Person UUID\\\", when the information is missing or different from the information that you find in SuccessFactors, it should be a sync issue and it has to be done again.

specifically they want to understand if a regular full load is part of this concept.</span>.<span dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</span>.Best regards,.Jamie.Dear Gokula,.Thanks for your feedback..&nbsp;.To me this seemingly confirms that the user is not being missed..I have reached out to CE API dev team to get their thoughts on the situation, I will let you know once I have received feedback..&nbsp;.Best regards,.Jamie.Hi Gokula,.We seem to be going back &amp; forth there without any progress in a number of days..&nbsp;.As I have mentioned on numerous occasions, I cannot test od example the behaviour of any query without API credentials &amp; there seems to be no feedback on any of the points about credentials from my last message..&nbsp;&nbsp;.Additionally I am not suggesting you use the <span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\"><strong>test</strong></span> I suggested to replicate 300 employees &amp; not sure why you interpret the feedback in this way as it is simply a test that has been requested for 1 of <em>(or the 3)</em> sample users you provided in the various division:.&nbsp;&nbsp;.I have requested credentials for testing on my end to progress this &amp; I have suggested tests to do on your end to progress, neither of which seems to have been done..Please let me be very clear here - I can offer no further inputs here currently &amp; we cannot proceed here without these tests &amp; will have no choice be to close the ticket if these point continue to be ignored..&nbsp;.Regards,.Jamie.Dear Gokula,.We discussed the provision of the API credentials on the earlier call..&nbsp;&nbsp;.As mentioned on this call &amp; in previous tickets on which we worked together, it is not possible to use: \\\"OAuth2 SAML Bearer Assertion\\\" to authenticate against the API &amp; test this from my end.&nbsp;.Alternatively, please reach out internally to discuss the possibility of providing basic auth credentials for the purposes of testing JMS query against the missed users so we can validate this on API directly:.&nbsp;&nbsp;.I have checked the data via UI in the meantime &amp; I cannot find any any further clues as to why they would need to be returned as the data meets the filter criteria, so this needs to be tested directly on API - see attached -&nbsp;<em><strong>BT_sampleData_checks.docx</strong></em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;.I understand the credentials may be time consuming to provide but they are needed for accurate testing here so please follow up on this from your end.However, in the interest of keeping this moving, as an alternative, &amp; if possible, you can test onf of the JMS runs against one of these employees with an explicit filter, so for example:.Similar to the approach used in the recent Very High issue this should tell us if there is some issue which completely prevents the users being returned (for example permissions like previously ).You can create a test process process for this if you wish &amp; please ensure the logs are captured for this test.same approach can be applied to any missed user / division in JMS query.&nbsp;&nbsp;.<strong>Please Note: </strong>this suggestion is only in absence of the API credentials &amp; direct testing, as direct testing is by far the quickest way to get this tested &amp; would allow us to gather everything we need from our end to progress here..&nbsp;&nbsp;.Thanks &amp; best regards,.Jamie.I have checked the logs and they cannot be compared because there is no data in the logs provided in: <strong>SFAPI Logs - HRI119_SF_EC_to_CDDE_EmployeeData_Recon.zip</strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;.Additionally, in attachment: <strong>SFAPI Aduit Logs - HRI119_SF_EC_to_CDDE_EmployeeData_Recon_JMS.zip</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;.From what I see in backend, the queries are as follows:.&nbsp; &nbsp;.Please provide following details:.&nbsp;.Regards,.Jamie&nbsp;.Thank you Gokula,.I will review &amp; aim to have further feedback / update for you before EOD tomorrow..&nbsp;.Regards,.Jamie.Hi Gokula,&nbsp;.I have extended the meeting invite for the requested time slot..I will be placing the case on your end in the meantime as I cannot move forward with any further analysis without the confirmations requested in my previous message..&nbsp;&nbsp;.Have a good weekend..&nbsp;.Best regards,.Jamie.Hi Gokula,.Thanks, I have been able to review further in backend based on these IDs but unfortunately I am no closer to isolating this problem to further analyze it..&nbsp;.In <strong>AGYE-VBK370iPf31-ZfEsgna3GyF</strong> there is <strong>3214 </strong>API requests:.&nbsp; &nbsp;.In <strong>AGYFMvmerXX5neWghUDqVgQRx6vQ </strong>there is <strong>534 </strong>API requests:.&nbsp; &nbsp;.There is a huge difference between these executions so I am not clear how how I am supposed to compare these when there is such a huge difference..&nbsp;.Additionally, you've shared only the OData log for <strong>VendorInfo </strong>object so is the missed records being missed only from this API?.I am also not clear on what the the UIN represents in the attached file with missed records OR what API these are coming from..&nbsp; &nbsp;.I have taken a deeper look into the <strong>EmpJob </strong>requests because I know these hold org. assignments &amp; can see the following filter used in the smaller execution:.&nbsp;&nbsp;.SuccessFactors cannot evaluate this from custom process perspective, only from API perspective.Please be more specific here in terms of the API you are reporting this data loss problem for &amp; what the missed examples represent&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.Please also provide API credentials for testing &amp; validation on API end:.&nbsp;.Regards,.Jamie.Dear Customer,.I hope this message finds you well &amp; thanks for reaching out..&nbsp;.I am not getting any matches in backend for the \\\"Correlation Id\\\" values provided, are these the CPI Message IDs or the CPI Correlation IDs?.We need Message ID(s)..&nbsp;.I checked also based on process name \\\"BT_IF_HRI119_SF EC_to_CDDE_EmployeeData_Recon\\\" in backend for last 7 days &amp; also got no matches.If these details are not being rendered in the headers of the the request coming form your customer process, I do not believe it will be possible to assess this fully..&nbsp;.Additionally, there doesn't seem to be enough information provided here for what you are reporting. These are custom process which we do not support&nbsp;.The output files are generated from your custom process &amp; the these output files cannot be used to validate the behaviour our API.<em>&nbsp;</em>.Thanks in advance &amp; best regards,.Jamie.Dear customer,.Thank you for contacting Product Support - People!
