Hello Customer,. Good day!. Apologies for the delay in response.. We checked with SAC team on the current issue and as per current system design, the story report that was created by individual user belongs to private folder.. If the folder is private, the user cannot duplicate the story. As admin will have access to public and private files/folders, admin user has no issue in duplicating the story. i.e., users who have story admin permission are able to duplicate the story report without any errors..

Hello Rahis,. Good day!. Like informed in the previous updates, the users do not have \\\"Story admin\\\" permission and hence the error faced.. If the same copy is required for the shared user, they need to perform \\\"save As\\\" and use it. This will create a copy of the original report that is shared with the affected user.. Please follow the below steps:<br />1.Login directly as the affected user (say \\\"Christian Prange\\\")<br />2.Edit the shared story reported-&gt; \\\"Save as\\\"-&gt;provide a new story name as per your requirement.<br />3.Go back to the report center.<br />4.You will now see the copy of report with the newly saved name (which is ideally same as duplicate operation). NOTE: The \\\"Save as\\\" operation will not work in case of \\\"<strong>P</strong><strong>roxy scenario</strong>\\\" as this has a limitation, so the \\\"save as\\\" is expected to fail with an error message in case of proxy, please be informed that <strong>\\\"save as\\\" operation works as expected in case of DIRECT LOGIN as affected user.</strong>.

Like informed before the users who have \\\"Story admin\\\" permissions are able to duplicate the report without any errors..

Thanks and regards,<br />Monika A. &nbsp;.

OR is the user facing the same error \\\"Error occurred while copying artifact.\\\" while duplicating through direct login and not as proxy.. &nbsp;. Thanks and regards,<br />Monika A. Hello Customer,. Good day!!. We were able to replicate the issue and we need additional confirmation from your end.. Could you please try to login directly as the affected user i.e., \\\"Christian Prange\\\" instead of proxying to this user and then try to duplicate the report story shared with the user, let us know if you still face the issue while duplicating.. We would like to know, if <span dir=\\\"ltr\\\">for same user with direct login access though he is not a story admin is working fine and proxy alone has issues.</span>. <br />Thanks and regards,<br />Monika A. Hello Customer,. Good day!. Apologies for the delay in response.. We checked with SAC team on the current issue and as per current system design, the story report that was created by individual user belongs to private folder.. If the folder is private, the user cannot duplicate the story. As admin will have access to public and private files/folders, admin user has no issue in duplicating the story. i.e., users who have story admin permission are able to duplicate the story report without any errors.. We will check internally on this behavior at our end and will update you with document.. I hope this addresses your issue, kindly let me know in case of any concerns/queries.. &nbsp;.

NOTE: The \\\"Save as\\\" operation will not work in case of \\\"<strong>P</strong><strong>roxy scenario</strong>\\\" as this has a limitation, so the \\\"save as\\\" is expected to fail with an error message in case of proxy, please be informed that <strong>\\\"save as\\\" operation works as expected in case of DIRECT LOGIN as affected user.</strong>.

Hello Customer,. Good day!. Apologies for the delay in response.. We checked with SAC team on the current issue and as per current system design, the story report that was created by individual user belongs to private folder.. If the folder is private, the user cannot duplicate the story. As admin will have access to public and private files/folders, admin user has no issue in duplicating the story. i.e., users who have story admin permission are able to duplicate the story report without any errors..
